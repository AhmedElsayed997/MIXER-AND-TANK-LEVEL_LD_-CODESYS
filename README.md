# MIXER-AND-TANK-LEVEL_LD_-CODESYS

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates an automated control system for a mixing and tank level management process
using the CODESYS platform. It consists of two main functions: monitoring the fluid level inside a tank and
controlling the motor and gate of a mixer system.

## Implementation Method: 
The control system logic was developed using Ladder Diagrams (LD) within the CODESYS development environment.

Ladder Diagrams (LD) were used to represent the control logic visually in a format similar to electrical relay logic, making it intuitive and easy to understand, test, and debug. 

This method is especially effective for industrial automation applications where reliability and clarity are critical.

## Main Features: 
- Motor start/stop control with overload protection.
- Gate open/close automation with animation counters.
- VFD speed control linked to a sensor's reading.
- Tank level monitoring and display.
- Visual interface with buttons and indicators for MIXER and TANK operation.
- Navigation interface with MAIN MENU to access different process pages.
